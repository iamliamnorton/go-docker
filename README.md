## Why Docker and Go?

- Web applications typically have template and configuration files. Docker helps keep these files in sync with the binary.
- Docker ensures identical setups in development and production. There are times when an application works in development, but not in production. Using Docker frees you from having to worry about problems like these.
- Machines, operating systems and installed software can vary significantly across a large team. Docker provides a mechanism to ensure a consistent development setup. This makes teams more productive and reduces friction and avoidable issues during development.
